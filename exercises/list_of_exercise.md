1. **Addition Function**: Write a function that takes two numbers from the user, adds them, and displays the result. [done](./addition.asm)
2. **Subtraction Function**: Similar to the previous exercise, write a function that subtracts two numbers and displays the result.
3. **Multiplication Function**: Write a function that multiplies two numbers and displays the result.
4. **Division Function**: Write a function that divides two numbers and displays the result. Be sure to handle the case where the denominator is zero. [done](./division.asm)
5. **Factorial Function**: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. [done](./factorial.asm)
6. **Fibonacci Series**: Write a program that generates the Fibonacci series up to a given number n. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. [done](./Fibonacci_Series.asm)
7. **String Reversal**: Write a function that reverses a string. For example, if the input string is "hello", the function should return "olleh". [done](./reverse_string.asm)
8. **String Length**: Write a function that calculates the length of a string without using any built-in functions.
9. **String Copy**: Write a function that copies one string to another location in memory.
10. **Array Sum**: Write a function that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters and returns the sum of the elements in the array.
11. **Array Average**: Based on the previous exercise, write a function that calculates the average of an array of integers.
12. **Find Maximum**: Write a function that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters and returns the largest number in the array.
13. **Find Minimum**: Similar to the previous exercise, write a function that finds the smallest number in an array.
14. **Bubble Sort**: Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
15. **Insertion Sort**: Implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
16. **Linear Search**: Write a function that performs a linear search on an array of integers.
17. **Binary Search**: Write a function that performs a binary search on a sorted array of integers.
